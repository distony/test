Details regarding the OnePlus 7 Pro have leaked consistently over the last few weeks, but the phone was formally unveiled just today at the company's launch event in New York City. The phone delivers quite a few new features, including a 6.67" 90Hz display and a pop-up front-facing camera, and improvement to haptics, as well as all the accouterments expected in a 2019 flagship like a Snapdragon 855 SoC, proprietary fast-charging upgrades \(30W this time around\), and super-fast UFS 3.0 storage. You get all that starting at $670.
