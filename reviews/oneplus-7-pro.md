The OnePlus 7 Pro is the first smartphone to be equipped with new UFS 3.0 flash storage chips. OnePlus says the new standard is about nine times faster than the UFS 2.1 storage found in other smartphones like the iPhone. On top of that, the OnePlus 7 Pro can be purchased with as much as 12GB of RAM, which is three times more RAM than the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max.



The 256GB OnePlus 7 Pro I’ve been testing has 12GB of RAM and it is remarkably fast. It will be interesting to see how it stacks up against the iPhone XS when real-life speed tests being hitting YouTube.



Warp Charge 30

Charging speed is one area where Apple just can’t seem to catch up with its Android rivals. Its latest iPhones support faster wired and wireless charging speeds than earlier models, but they’re still nowhere close to matching flagship Android phones.



The OnePlus 7 Pro still doesn’t include wireless charging support, which is infuriating. It makes up for the omission at least in part by supporting lightning-fast wired charging speeds of up to 30 watts. OnePlus’ Warp Charge 30 technology is 38% faster than its previous-generation fast charging tech, and it’s almost twice as fast as Apple’s iPhone XS, XS Max, and XR, which max out at 18 watts.

A reasonable price tag
